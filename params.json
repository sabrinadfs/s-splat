  "body": "#### Abstract\r\nTesting configurable systems is important and challenging due to the enormous space of configurations where errors can hide. Existing approaches to test these systems are often costly or unreliable. This paper proposes S-SPLat a technique that combines heuristic sampling with symbolic search to obtain both breadth and depth in the exploration of the configuration space. S-SPLat builds on SPLat, our previously developed technique, that explores all reachable configurations from tests. In contrast to its predecessor, S-SPLat sacrifices soundness in favor of efficiency. We evaluated our technique on eight software product lines of various sizes and on a large configurable system (GCC). Considering the results for GCC, S-SPLat was able to reproduce all five bugs that we previously found in a previous study with SPLat but much faster and it was able to find two new bugs in a recent release of GCC. Results suggest that it is preferable to use a combination of simple heuristics to drive the symbolic search as opposed to a single heuristic that enforces a large set of test requirements. S-SPLat and our experimental infrastructure are publicly available.\r\n\r\n[Sabrina Souto](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~sfs/), [Marcelo d'Amorim](http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~damorim/), [Rohit Gheyi](http://www.dsc.ufcg.edu.br/~rohit/Rohit_Gheyi/Home.html)\r\n***\r\n\r\n#### Artifact Evaluation - ICSE 2017 submission\r\nThe artifact evaluation contains all the artifacts used in this paper, including the source code, the data set and scripts to generate tables and plots. We explain how to reproduce the results using a single virtual machine.

On terminal, run the following commands:\r\n  \r\n      > docker-machine create --driver virtualbox default (Create a new Docker VM)\r\n      > docker-machine ls (List your available machines)\r\n      > docker-machine env default (Get the environment commands for your new VM)\r\n      > eval \"$(docker-machine env default)\" (Connect your shell to the default machine)\r\n      > docker load < /yourpath/s-splat.tar\r\n\r\n\r\n***\r\n#### Artifact Organization\r\n\r\n***\r\n##### Experiments for SPLs\r\n\r\n_Running S-SPLat_\r\n\r\n     1.\r\n     2.\r\n     3.\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n_Reproducing Results_\r\n\r\n     1.\r\n     2.\r\n     3.\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n##### Experiments for GCC\r\n\r\n_Running S-SPLat_\r\n\r\n     1.\r\n     2.\r\n     3.\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n_Reproducing Results_\r\n\r\n     1.\r\n     2.\r\n     3.\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
